<h2>About us</h2>
<p>Esmeraldus Colombian Coffee was founded in 2023 by Gabriela and Santiago, two Colombians with a passion for coffee. Having grown up within the rich coffee culture of Colombia, they knew they had a unique opportunity to share the country's finest coffee beans with the world. As a result, they began importing the freshest, highest quality coffee directly from Colombia to Canada.

Their goal is simple yet ambitious: to ensure that every morning, people can enjoy a cup of coffee that is truly fresh and delicious. Esmeraldus Colombian Coffee is committed to sourcing only the finest beans from trusted farmers in Colombia, and using ethical and sustainable practices at every stage of the coffee-making process. In addition, Esmeraldus Colombian Coffee is committed to supporting the farmers in Colombia who grow these incredible beans, which is why they donate one dollar from every bag of coffee purchased to support the growth and development of Colombian and Canadian coffee farmers. With their dedication to quality and authenticity, Gabriela and Santiago are proud to bring the rich flavours and aromas of Colombian coffee to coffee lovers in Canada and beyond.</p>
